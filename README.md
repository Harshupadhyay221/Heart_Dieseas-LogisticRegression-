# Heart Disease Prediction Algorithm

This repository contains code for a machine learning algorithm that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using logistic regression.

## Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This algorithm utilizes logistic regression, a commonly used classification algorithm, to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various medical features.

## Dataset

The algorithm uses the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harsh221upadhyay/heart-dataset)) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical measurements, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
